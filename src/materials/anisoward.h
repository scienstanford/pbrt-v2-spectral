	This file is an extension to pbrt.  It implements a material that
	uses the anisotropic Ward model.  Ben Heasly wrote anisoward.cpp 
	and anisoward.h based on PBRT's plastic.c and plastic.h.  
	AnisoWardBrdf.cpp and AnisoWardBrdf.h were downloaded from the 
	University of Freiburg at 
	http://cg.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/course_notes/SS12/ACG/.
